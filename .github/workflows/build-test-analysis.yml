# This workflow will trigger on every push or pull request to the main branch. It will run on the ubuntu-latest environment and perform the following steps:
# 1. Check out the code from the repository.
# 2. Set up Java 17 on the runner.
# 3. Build the project using Maven.
# 4. Run the unit tests using Maven.
# 5. Cache the Maven repository to speed up builds.
# 6. Generate an HTML report of the test results using the JUnit Test Report action.
